		<h1>Morning Routine</h1>
		<p>
			Each morning I have a couple of very tiny <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits" target="_blank">atomic
				habits</a> that I do
			in order to chip away at goals or <a href="#first-area">areas of growth</a> that I have in
			mind for myself. Currently there's only three, and I change them
			out for others as I reach my goals. So some of the ones I'm doing
			currenlty I have been doing for a while now, while others I've
			just recently cycled into my morning routine.
		</p>
		<p>
			So allow me to share what they are and how I budget time for them
			each day.
		</p>
		<p>
			To get started I use a Pomodoro Timer to make sure I am actually
			using the full time I've budgeted for each habit practice task.
			The specific timer I use is called, Flow. I like it because you can
			set your intervals and rounds to fit your needs.
		</p>
		<p id="first-area">
			The first area of improvement I have been working on for a few
			months now is my typing accuracy and speed. I've been notoriously
			slow and inaccurate in my past and finally decided to take a go
			at changing that. So for about 2 months and a few weeks now I
			practice for five minutes every morning using a site called,
			TypingClub.
		</p>
		<p>
			My next area of focus has been getting back to practicing drums.
			It's been a while since I was serious about practicing drums and
			I can tell a difference lol. So each morning I set aside ten to
			fifteen minutes to practice various skills
		</p>
		<p>
			So this concludes my little bit about my atomic habits.
